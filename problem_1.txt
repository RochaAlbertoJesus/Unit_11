Node.js is a server-side platform. The language that is used for the node is javaScript.
There are a couple of features of Node.js. 1.) Node.js is asynchronous and event driven 
meaning that when code executes it read it, but it never waits for the response, however it
will come back to execute the the response pending. 2.) It is very fast using chrome's v8 javaScript
engine. 3.) Node.js is single threaded. Do to the fact that Node.js respones in a non-blocking
manner it allows it to be highly scalable. 4.) Lastly, Node.js does not buffer data meaning 
as soon as it gets data it releases it.
